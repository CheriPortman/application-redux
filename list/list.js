//on this page, I want to get a list of each person in localStorage
    //task before this page: make an object of submissions, done in the eventLister.    

//Once I have an object, I will:
    //create place in html for data to be rendered
    //get Nodes into JS
    //grab data
    //parse the data
    //get the data onto the list

//Once I get a list, I need to make the name value into an anchor 
    //send user to the user detail

//then it's done!
